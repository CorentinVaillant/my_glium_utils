# My glium util

This library contains all my utilities for projects using the Glium crate.
Feel free to use it, and don’t hesitate to report any bugs you find,
or to ask me questions about how to use it.

However, don’t expect regular updates or bug fixes — I work on this in my free time,
alongside my studies, which already take up a lot of my time.
